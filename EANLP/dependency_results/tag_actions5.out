Sentence 12: a av v t The symbol or delta just means change
dobj:  means ( change )

Sentence 13: a av v f - v i t f - t i In this equation v f is the final velocity and v i is the initial or starting velocity
dobj:  t ( i )

Sentence 14: Find the initial and final velocity of the object
dobj:  Find ( velocity )

Sentence 15: For example if a car goes from parked on the sidewalk to moving at a velocity of 500 meters second to the right the initial velocity is 0 m s and the final velocity is 500 m s right

Sentence 16: From now on we ll use positive numbers to describe motion to the right so we don t have to specify the direction every time
dobj:  use ( numbers )
dobj:  describe ( motion )
dobj:  don ( t )
dobj:  specify ( time )

Sentence 17: If the car starts out going forward and ends up going backward make sure to write the final velocity as a negative number
dobj:  write ( velocity )

Sentence 18: Note the change in time
dobj:  Note ( change )

Sentence 19: For instance the car might take 10 seconds to reach the final velocity
dobj:  take ( seconds )
dobj:  reach ( velocity )

Sentence 20: Unless the problem says otherwise this usually means t f 10 seconds and t i 0 seconds
dobj:  means ( seconds )

Sentence 21: Make sure your velocities and times are written in consistent units
nsubjpass:  written ( velocities )

Sentence 22: For instance if your velocity is written in miles per hour the time should be written in hours as well
nsubjpass:  written ( velocity )
nsubjpass:  written ( time )

Sentence 23: Use these numbers to calculate average acceleration
dobj:  Use ( numbers )
dobj:  calculate ( acceleration )

Sentence 24: Put the velocities and time into the formula to find the average acceleration
dobj:  Put ( velocities )
dobj:  find ( acceleration )

Sentence 25: In our example

Sentence 26: a av 500 m s - 0 m s 10s - 0s

Sentence 27: a av 500 m s 10 s

Sentence 28: a av 50 m s s This can also be written as 50 m s 2
nsubjpass:  written ( m )

Sentence 29: -----LONG_TEXT_SEPARATOR-----

Sentence 30: Understand the result
dobj:  Understand ( result )

Sentence 31: The average acceleration describes how rapidly the velocity changed during the time we re examining on average

Sentence 32: In the example above the car was speeding up to the right and each second it sped up by an average of 50 m s

Sentence 33: Note that the details of the exact movement can change as long as the car ends up with the same total change in velocity and change in time

Sentence 34: The car could start at 0 m s and accelerates at a constant rate for 10 seconds until it reaches 500 m s
dobj:  reaches ( m )

Sentence 35: The car could start at 0 m s accelerate rapidly to 900 m s then slow down to 500 m s by the 10th second

Sentence 36: The car could start at 0 m s stay still for 9 seconds then jump to 500 m s very rapidly in the 10th second

Sentence 37: Understanding Positive and Negative Acceleration
dobj:  Understanding ( Acceleration )

Sentence 38: Know what positive and negative velocity represents

Sentence 39: Although velocity always specifies a direction it can be tedious to keep writing up or north or toward the wall Instead most math problems will assume the object is moving along a straight line
dobj:  specifies ( direction )
dobj:  assume ( object )

Sentence 40: Moving in one direction on this line gets described as a positive velocity and movement in the other direction is negative - velocity

Sentence 41: For example a blue train is moving east at 500 m s

Sentence 42: A red train is moving west equally fast but since it is in the opposite direction it is traveling at -500 m s instead

Sentence 43: Use the definition of acceleration to determine or - signs
dobj:  Use ( definition )
dobj:  determine ( signs )

Sentence 44: Acceleration is the change in velocity over time

Sentence 45: If you re confused about whether to write acceleration as positive or negative check the change in velocity and see what comes out
dobj:  write ( acceleration )

Sentence 46: v final - v initial or -

Sentence 47: Understand speeding up in each direction

Sentence 48: Let s say a blue train and a red train move away from each other with a speed of 5 m s

Sentence 49: We can picture these on a number line with the blue train moving at 5 m s along the positive side of the number line and the red train moving at -5 m s along the negative side
dobj:  picture ( these )

Sentence 50: If each train starts to accelerate until it reaches 2 m s faster in the direction it is moving does each train have positive or negative acceleration
dobj:  have ( acceleration )

Sentence 51: Let s check

Sentence 52: The blue train is moving faster along the positive side so it s increasing from 5 m s to 7 m s

Sentence 53: The final velocity minus the initial velocity is 7 - 5 2

Sentence 54: Since the change in velocity is positive so is the acceleration

Sentence 55: The red train is moving faster along the negative side so it starts out -5 m s but ends up going -7 m s
dobj:  starts ( s )
dobj:  going ( s )

Sentence 56: The final velocity minus the initial velocity is -7 - -5 -7 5 -2 m s

Sentence 57: Since the change in velocity is negative so is the acceleration

Sentence 58: Understand slowing down

Sentence 59: Let s say a plane starts out traveling at 500 miles per hour but then slows down to 400 miles per hour

Sentence 60: Although it s still moving in a positive or forward direction the plane s acceleration was negative because it s moving less quickly forward than before

Sentence 61: You can check this the same way as the examples above 400 - 500 -100 so the acceleration is negative
dobj:  check ( way )

Sentence 62: -----LONG_TEXT_SEPARATOR-----

Sentence 63: Meanwhile if a helicopter is moving -100 miles per hour and accelerates to -50 miles per hour it has experienced positive acceleration
dobj:  moving ( miles )
dobj:  experienced ( acceleration )

Sentence 64: This is because the change in velocity was in the positive direction -50 - -100 50 even though the change was not enough to reverse the helicopter s direction
