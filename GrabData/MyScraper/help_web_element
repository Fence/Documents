Help on WebElement in module selenium.webdriver.remote.webelement object:

class WebElement(__builtin__.object)
 |  Represents a DOM element.
 |
 |  Generally, all interesting operations that interact with a document will be
 |  performed through this interface.
 |
 |  All method calls will do a freshness check to ensure that the element
 |  reference is still valid.  This essentially determines whether or not the
 |  element is still attached to the DOM.  If this test fails, then an
 |  ``StaleElementReferenceException`` is thrown, and all future calls to this
 |  instance will fail.

 |  get_attribute(self, name)
 |      Gets the given attribute or property of the element.
 |
 |      This method will first try to return the value of a property with the
 |      given name. If a property with that name doesn't exist, it returns the
 |      value of the attribute with the same name. If there's no attribute with
 |      that name, ``None`` is returned.
 |
 |      Values which are considered truthy, that is equals "true" or "false",
 |      are returned as booleans.  All other non-``None`` values are returned
 |      as strings.  For attributes or properties which do not exist, ``None``
 |      is returned.
 |
 |      :Args:
 |          - name - Name of the attribute/property to retrieve.
 |
 |      Example::
 |
 |          # Check if the "active" CSS class is applied to an element.

 |
 |  get_property(self, name)
 |      Gets the given property of the element.
 |
 |      :Args:
 |          - name - Name of the property to retrieve.

 |
 |          # Check if the "active" CSS class is applied to an element.
 |          text_length = target_element.get_property("text_length")
 |
 |  is_displayed(self)

 |          file_input.send_keys("path/to/profilepic.gif")
 |          # Generally it's better to wrap the file path in one of the methods
 |          # in os.path to return the actual path to support cross OS testing.
 |          # file_input.send_keys(os.path.abspath("path/to/profilepic.gif"))
