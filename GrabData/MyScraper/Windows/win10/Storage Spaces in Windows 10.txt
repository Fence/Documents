Storage Spaces helps protect your data from drive failures and extend storage over time as you add drives to your PC
You can use Storage Spaces to group two or more drives together in a storage pool and then use capacity from that pool to create virtual drives called storage spaces
These storage spaces typically store two copies of your data so if one of your drives fails you still have an intact copy of your data
If you run low on capacity just add more drives to the storage pool
Show all What do I need to create a storage space
You need at least two extra drives in addition to the drive where Windows is installed These drives can be internal or external hard drives or solid state drives
You can use a variety of types of drives with Storage Spaces including USB SATA and SAS drives
How do I create a storage space
Add or connect the drives that you want to group together with Storage Spaces
Go to the taskbar type Storage Spaces in the search box and select Storage Spaces from the list of search results
Select Create a new pool and storage space
Select the drives you want to add to the new storage space and then select Create pool
Give the drive a name and letter and then choose a layout
Two way mirror Three way mirror and Parity can help protect the files in the storage space from drive failure
Enter the maximum size the storage space can reach and then select Create storage space
Should I create a simple mirror or parity space
Simple spaces are designed for increased performance but don t protect your files from drive failure
They re best for temporary data such as video rendering files image editor scratch files and intermediary compiler object files
Simple spaces require at least two drives to be useful
Mirror spaces are designed for increased performance and protect your files from drive failure by keeping multiple copies
Two way mirror spaces make two copies of your files and can tolerate one drive failure while three way mirror spaces can tolerate two drive failures
Mirror spaces are good for storing a broad range of data from a general purpose file share to a VHD library
When a mirror space is formatted with the Resilient File System ReFS Windows will automatically maintain your data integrity which makes your files even more resilient to drive failure
Two way mirror spaces require at least two drives and three way mirror spaces require at least five
Parity spaces are designed for storage efficiency and protect your files from drive failure by keeping multiple copies
Parity spaces are best for archival data and streaming media like music and videos
This storage layout requires at least three drives to protect you from a single drive failure and at least seven drives to protect you from two drive failures
Should I upgrade my pool
After you upgrade to Windows 10 we recommend that you upgrade your existing pools
With an upgraded pool you can optimize drive usage and remove drives from pools without affecting the pool s protection from drive failure
NoteUpgraded pools aren t compatible with previous versions of Windows
When should I optimize drive usage
When you add new drives to an existing pool it s a good idea to optimize drive usage
This will move some of your data to the newly added drive to make the best use of the pool s capacity
It ll happen by default when you add a new drive to an upgraded pool in Windows 10 you ll see a check box for Optimize to spread existing data across all drives selected when you add the drive
However if you cleared that check box or added drives before upgrading a pool you ll need to manually optimize drive usage
To do so type Storage Spaces in the search box on the taskbar select Storage Spaces from the list of search results and then select Optimize drive usage
How do I remove a drive from a pool
If you created a pool in Windows 10 or upgraded an existing pool you ll be able to remove a drive from it
The data stored on that drive will be moved to other drives in the pool and you ll be free to use the drive for something else
Go to the taskbar type Storage Spaces in the search box and select Storage Spaces from the list of search results
Select Change settings Physical drives to see all the drives in your pool
Find the drive you want to remove and select Prepare for removal Prepare for removal
Leave your PC plugged in until the drive is ready to be removed
This could take several hours depending on how much data you have stored there
Optional To speed up drive preparation prevent your PC from going to sleep
Type Power and sleep in the search box on the taskbar then select Power sleep settings
Under When plugged in PC goes to sleep after select Never
When the drive is listed as Ready to remove select Remove Remove drive
Now you can disconnect the drive from your PC
NoteIf you run into problems when you try to prepare the drive for removal it might be because you don t have enough free space in the pool to store all the data from the drive you want to remove
Try adding a new drive to the pool that s as large as the drive you plan to remove and then try again
