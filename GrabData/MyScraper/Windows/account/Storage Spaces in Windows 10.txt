Storage Spaces helps protect your data from drive failures and extend storage over time as you add drives to your PC
You can use Storage Spaces to group two or more drives together in a storage pool and then use capacity from that pool to create virtual drives called storage spaces
These storage spaces typically store two copies of your data so if one of your drives fails you still have an intact copy of your data
If you run low on capacity just add more drives to the storage pool
