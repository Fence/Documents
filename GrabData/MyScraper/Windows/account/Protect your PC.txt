Windows 10 is safer and more secure thanks to Windows Defender and Windows Firewall
When you start Windows 10 for the first time Windows Defender works to help protect your PC by scanning for malicious or unwanted software
Windows Defender uses real time protection to scan everything you download or run on your PC
To scan specific files or folders select them then right click or press and hold and choose Scan with Windows Defender
If Windows Defender finds anything malicious it notifies you in the app and recommends what you should do next to keep your PC safe
Windows Firewall filters the information coming into your PC from the Internet blocking potentially harmful programs
