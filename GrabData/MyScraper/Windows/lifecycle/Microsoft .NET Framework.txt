Are there any breaking changes in NET Framework 4

Why do you include these changes
There are a very small number of changes fixes in NET Framework 4
5
2 that are not fully compatible with earlier NET versions
Such fixes are included only when necessary in the interests of security comply with industry wide standards or to correct a previous incompatibility
A list of breaking changes in the runtime can be found here

Does this mean the version of the NET Framework that was included with Visual Studio takes the Lifecycle Policy of Visual Studio
No
Versions of the NET Framework that shipped with host products other than Microsoft Windows shipped with a Windows Supplemental Microsoft Software License Terms
This means that the component is considered part of the Windows operating system
What is the Lifecycle Policy for the different versions of the NET Framework
