What is the Microsoft Support Lifecycle policy for Windows
Microsoft Windows follows the Business Developer and Desktop Operating System Software Products policy
As such Microsoft will offer a minimum of 10 years of support for Business Developer and Desktop Operating System consumer or business Software Products
Mainstream Support for Business Developer and Desktop Operating Systems will be provided for 5 years or for 2 years after the successor product N 1 is released whichever is longer
Microsoft will also provide Extended Support for the 5 years following Mainstream support or for 2 years after the second successor product N 2 is released whichever is longer
Finally most Business Developer and Desktop Operating System Software products will receive at least 10 years of online self help support
2
Is there a different Microsoft Support Lifecycle policy for consumers and businesses for the Windows operating system
All Desktop Operating System products whether used for personal or business purposes receive a minimum of 10 years of support minimum of 5 years Mainstream Support and minimum of 5 years Extended Support at the supported service pack level
Microsoft does not differentiate Microsoft Support Lifecycle policy between consumer and business versions of Desktop Operating System products
3
If I obtained Windows when I purchased a new personal computer who provides support for my Windows desktop operating system
If you obtained a retail packaged product copy of a Windows desktop operating system you are eligible for support from Microsoft subject to the Microsoft Support Lifecycle policy and to the support terms and conditions that were in place at the time of purchase
If you acquired your Windows desktop operating system through the Microsoft Volume Licensing program or from an Original Equipment Manufacturer OEM Microsoft offers access to a wealth of online self help support content in addition to paid technical assistance offerings
If you acquired your Windows desktop operating system through an OEM you may also contact your OEM for more information about the support offerings for Windows desktop operating systems from that OEM
4
What other options do I have for getting support
Microsoft offers no charge self help tools and content on the Microsoft Help and Support Web site
These resources include the Microsoft Knowledge Base how to articles troubleshooting information frequently asked questions TechNet Support Webcasts community newsgroups and more
You can also gain access to comprehensive Help files and troubleshooting information by clicking Start in Microsoft Windows 7 or by going to Search in Windows 8
1 and typing in help
5
After the Microsoft assisted and paid support offerings have ended what are my options if I want to continue to receive support
Microsoft encourages all customers to remain current to ensure that they stay supported and can take advantage of innovations found in the latest products
Staying current also minimizes security risks compliance risks and frequently lowers the total cost of ownership
Once a product transitions out of support no further support will be provided for the product
This means that customers will not have access to
Security updates or non security hotfixesFree or paid assisted support optionsThe option to engage Microsoft product development resourcesUpdates to online content KB articles etc
Online content may be available if the product is still within the Online Self Help Support phase
Microsoft has created a Web site that lists the support options that are available for Microsoft products that no longer receive assisted support from Microsoft
For more information visit the Retired Product Support Options Web site

When a Windows desktop operating system reaches the end of its lifecycle or is no longer supported does that mean new programs will not run on that operating system
Even if an operating system is no longer available for purchase or support through Microsoft that operating system may still work with programs and with hardware that become available after sale or support of the operating system is discontinued
However as an operating system ages the chance that new programs will not be performant on the operating system increases
The chance that an older non supported operating system will not be performant on new hardware also increases
This frequently occurs because the manufacturers of new hardware and of new software make product design decisions that take advantage of the increased functionality and features in newer operating systems
These manufacturers may decide that discontinuing support of their products on older operating systems is appropriate

What is the Microsoft Support Lifecycle policy for Windows 8
1
Windows 8
1 falls under the same lifecycle policy as Windows 8 and will reach end of Mainstream Support on January 9 2018 and end of Extended Support on January 10 2023
With the General Availability of Windows 8
1 customers on Windows 8 have 2 years until January 12 2016 to move to Windows 8
1 in order to remain supported
8
Why are you requiring Windows 8 customers move to Windows 8
1 two years after the General Availability
Historically we ve had a similar support approach related to Windows service packs when a Windows service pack is released Microsoft provides customers 24 months of support for the prior service pack or original RTM version
Unlike service packs that are typically just a collection of fixes Windows 8
1 has new features and enhancements
We designed Windows 8
1 to give customers an ability to deploy this update in a manner that is similar to how customers deploy service packs therefore we are applying the existing service pack support policy to Windows 8
1
Windows 8
1 does not change any hardware requirements compared with Windows 8 or Windows 7 and existing Windows Store apps will work with Windows 8
1
The update has little to no impact on existing desktop apps and there is no direct software cost because business customers with Software Assurance licensing will receive Windows 8
1 as a free update
For organizations running legacy applications that need to be upgraded there are tools to manage deployment in order to help mitigate cost and impact
9
What is Windows 8
1 Update
How does it impact the Windows 8 Support Lifecycle
Windows 8
1 Update is a cumulative update for Windows 8

How does the End of Support for Windows XP impact Windows Embedded products
Windows Embedded products have their own distinct support lifecycles based on when the product was released and made generally available
It is important for businesses to understand the support implications for these products in order to ensure that systems remain up to date and secure
The following Windows Embedded products are based on Windows XP
Windows XP Professional for Embedded Systems
This product is identical to Windows XP and Extended Support will end on April 8 2014
Windows XP Embedded Service Pack 3 SP3 This is the original toolkit and componentized version of Windows XP
It was originally released in 2002 and Extended Support will end on Jan
12 2016
Windows Embedded for Point of Service SP3
This product is for use in Point of Sale devices
It s built from Windows XP Embedded
It was originally released in 2005 and Extended Support will end on April 12 2016
Windows Embedded Standard 2009
This product is an updated release of the toolkit and componentized version of Windows XP
It was originally released in 2008 and Extended Support will end on January 8 2019
Windows Embedded POSReady 2009
This product for Point of Sale devices reflects the updates available in Windows Embedded Standard 2009
It was originally released on 2009 and extended support will end on April 9 2019
11
Why does support for Windows XP Professional for Embedded Systems end with Windows XP
Windows XP Professional for Embedded Systems is a specially licensed version of Windows XP Professional for industry devices delivering the full features and functionality of Windows XP
Given this relationship both operating systems followed the same release schedule and share the same timeline 12
Why will Windows XP Embedded be supported for two years longer than Windows XP Professional for Embedded Systems
Windows XP Embedded is a modular form of Windows XP with additional functionality to support the needs of industry devices
It was released separately from Windows XP and provides a separate support lifecycle to address the unique needs of industry devices
Devices running Windows XP Embedded will be supported through 2016
13
What is the Microsoft Support Lifecycle policy for Windows Embedded 8
1 products
Windows Embedded 8
1 falls under the same lifecycle policy as Windows Embedded 8 with support ending 7 11 2023
Customers have 24 months to move to Windows Embedded 8
1 in order to remain supported
This applies to Windows Embedded 8 Industry Enterprise and Industry Pro
14
Are there any differences in what is provided in the Extended Support phase for Windows Embedded products than regular Windows products
The type of support provided in the Extended Support phase is consistent for all Business Developer and Desktop Operating System Software Products
Critical security updates are made available for products until the published Extended Support end date
This allows businesses to ensure that they are up to date in protection against security attacks
For Embedded products these updates will continue to be made available through the usual channels of MyOEM Windows Embedded Developer Update WEDU and Microsoft OEM Online MOO as well as through Microsoft Update for the Point of Sale systems
15
What does this mean for other parts of the system
While most of the Windows Embedded Operating System will continue to receive critical security updates it is important to ensure that other parts of the system that are not part of the operating system are also kept up to date and that protections are in place
This includes items such as software included on the device antivirus solutions and management solutions on the device as well as throughout the IT infrastructure
Check with the providers of all parts of the infrastructure to ensure that they will continue to offer support for XP based platforms
Microsoft will continue to provide anti malware definition updates to those operating systems licensed to run our anti malware products through their end of life dates
Supporting the latest processor and chipsets on Windows Show all 16
