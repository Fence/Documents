Back to Microsoft Lifecycle home page Microsoft Lifecycle Policies have traditionally addressed two different product types
On premises and Online Services
Microsoft has simplified these policies by extending existing support and servicing indefinitely for certain products and services
For products governed by the Modern Lifecycle Policy Microsoft will provide a minimum of 12 months notification prior to ending support if no successor product or service is offered excluding free services or preview releases
Products with existing Lifecycle Policies will continue to be supported according to published end of support dates
The Modern Lifecycle Policy requirements are defined below
Customers must stay current as per the servicing and licensing requirements published for the product or service
Customers must have the rights to use the product or service
Microsoft must currently offer support for the product or service
Please see the Modern Policy FAQs for more details
