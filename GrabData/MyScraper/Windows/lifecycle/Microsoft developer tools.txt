What is the Support Lifecycle policy for the Microsoft Silverlight product
Due to the way Microsoft Silverlight is released it does not take a Support Lifecycle typical of many Microsoft products and for clarification purposes is defined as a tool
A tool is defined as a utility or feature that aids in accomplishing a discrete task or a limited set of tasks
Major tool versions receive a minimum of 12 months notification prior to the end of support
Otherwise support ends at the same time as the product versions for which they are intended for example Microsoft Windows Note
Some tools may receive security updates or feature enhancements
Customers may be required to install the latest update of the supported tool s major version to receive support
Microsoft will continue to support Silverlight by shipping updates to the latest version of both Silverlight runtime and Silverlight SDK
Updates and new versions of the Silverlight runtime are backward compatible with web applications built in previous versions of Silverlight and will include the latest security enhancements performance improvements and product fixes

What version of Silverlight is currently supported
Microsoft will provide technical assistance paid and unpaid for customers using versions of Silverlight 5
Paid technical assistance is available to customers requiring support with issues beyond install and upgrade issues
Microsoft will continue to ship updates to the Silverlight 5 runtime or Silverlight 5 SDK for existing and newer browser versions given that their extensibility model supports plug ins including updates for security vulnerabilities as determined by the MSRC
Developers using the Silverlight 5 development tools and developing applications for Silverlight 5 can use paid technical assistance options to receive development support
Silverlight 5 will support the browser versions listed on this page through October 12 2021 or though the support lifecycle of the underlying browsers whichever is shorter
