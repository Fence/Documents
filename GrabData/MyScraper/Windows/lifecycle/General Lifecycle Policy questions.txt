Policy Show all What are the Microsoft lifecycle policies
Microsoft provides industry leading lifecycle policies in length and provision giving customers consistent transparent and predictable software support timelines
The Microsoft Lifecycle Policy standardizes Microsoft product support policies for business developer and desktop operating system software consumer and multimedia software and online services
The Lifecycle Policy was originally announced on October 15 2002
A Lifecycle Policy update went into effect June 1 2004 and applies to most business and developer products that were in Mainstream Support on June 1 2004 and to product versions released after that date
Business Developer and Desktop Operating System SoftwareMicrosoft will offer a minimum of 10 years of support for business developer and desktop operating system consumer and business products
Mainstream Support will be provided for 5 years or for 2 years after the successor product N 1 where N product version is released whichever is longer
Microsoft will also provide Extended Support for the 5 years following Mainstream Support or for 2 years after the second successor product N 2 is released whichever is longer
Most business developer and desktop operating system products will receive at least 10 years of online self help support
Consumer and Multimedia SoftwareMicrosoft will offer Mainstream Support for either a minimum of 5 years from the date of a product s general availability or for 2 years after the successor product N 1 is released whichever is longer
Extended Support is not offered for consumer software and multimedia products with the exception of Windows Desktop Operating System which follows the Business Developer and Desktop Operating System Software Policy as outlined above
Microsoft Xbox games are currently not included in the Lifecycle Policy
To find the support timelines for your product search the Lifecycle Product Database
Online ServicesMicrosoft support services will be available for the duration of the customer s agreement with Microsoft for the online service
Microsoft will provide notification when customers are required to take action in order to avoid significant degradation to the normal use of the online service for businesses and developers unless otherwise noted
Microsoft will provide a minimum of 12 months notice before ending an online service for business and developer customers without providing a successor service excluding free services or preview releases
Is this policy applicable globally
The Microsoft Lifecycle Policy is a worldwide policy
However Microsoft understands that local laws market conditions and support requirements differ around the world and by industry sector
For business developer and desktop operating system products Microsoft may offer custom support relationships that go beyond the Extended Support phase
These custom support relationships may include assisted support and security updates and may extend beyond 10 years from the date a product becomes generally available
Customers and partners can contact their account team or their local Microsoft representative for more information
Why was the Lifecycle Policy defined
Customers have asked Microsoft to be consistent and predictable
The Lifecycle Policy establishes a clear and predictable policy for product support timelines
The policy helps customers and partners manage their support requirements
The policy also allows both product planning and information technology planning in organizations based on knowledge of the support timelines for Microsoft products
How was the Lifecycle Policy developed
Microsoft worked closely with Microsoft product teams customers partners leading analysts and research firms to determine clear and consistent policies
If I have multiple Microsoft products do they all share the same lifecycle timelines
Each product has its lifecycle timeline defined per the Microsoft Lifecycle Policy and is consistent by product family for new and future versions
However older versions of Microsoft products may have different lifecycle timelines
Therefore it is important to verify the exact product support dates for your product
To find the support timelines for your product search the Lifecycle Product Database
What products do the lifecycle policies cover and when did they go into effect
The Business Developer and Desktop Operating System Software Policy went into effect October 15 2002 with a major revision on June 1 2004
This policy revision covers most products that were available through retail purchase or volume licensing as of June 1 2004 and most future products versions
For information about end of support timelines and Extended Support options for all products review the Microsoft Lifecycle page
In January 2011 Microsoft established the Online Services Lifecycle Policy
In August of 2016 Microsoft established the Modern Lifecycle Policy
Extended Support is not offered for consumer software multimedia products online services or products governed by the Modern Policy
How can customers and partners estimate the lifecycle for products that are not yet available or that are still in the Mainstream Support phase
The Lifecycle Policy is designed to take the guesswork out of the length of time Microsoft provides support for a product
For business developer and desktop operating system software Microsoft provides a minimum of 10 years of support
The lifecycle combines 5 years of Mainstream Support or 2 years after the successor product N 1 where N product version is released whichever is longer and 5 years Extended Support or 2 years after the second successor product N 2 is released whichever is longer
For consumer software and multimedia products Microsoft standardizes a minimum of 5 years of Mainstream Support or 2 years after the successor product N 1 is released whichever is longer For information about end of support dates and any Extended Support options if applicable for all products search the Lifecycle Product Database Extended Support is not offered for consumer software multimedia products online services or products governed by the Modern Policy
Is there a different Lifecycle Policy for consumers and businesses for the Windows Operating System
All desktop operating system products whether used for personal or business purposes receive a minimum of 10 years of support 5 years of Mainstream Support or 2 years after the successor product N 1 is released whichever is longer and 5 years Extended Support or 2 years after the second successor product N 2 is released whichever is longer at the supported service pack level
Microsoft does not differentiate support between consumer and business versions of desktop operating system products
What is the Lifecycle Policy for program add ons
Add ons are supported with the product they work with
However support may be terminated by providing a minimum 12 months notice
Please verify the exact product support dates as posted on the Lifecycle Product Database
What is the Lifecycle Policy for tools
Tools are supported with the product they work with
However support may be terminated by providing a minimum 12 months notice
What is the Lifecycle Policy for products or companies that Microsoft acquires
Products that were released before the acquisition date may not be covered under the Lifecycle Policy and may not be supported
In these cases support will be subject to the terms of the individual acquisition
Microsoft will publish the end of support dates for each acquired product on the Lifecycle web site where applicable
For these listings the Lifecycle Start Date is the acquisition start date
The end of Mainstream and Extended Support will vary based on the terms of the acquisition
Generally the Microsoft Lifecycle Policy applies to new software releases that are released under a Microsoft brand following the acquisition
What is the Lifecycle Policy for minor releases of major products
Minor releases follow the same lifecycle as the major product release
An example of this is Windows Server 2012 R2 which has the same Mainstream and Extended Support phase as the parent product Windows Server 2012
Likewise Dynamics AX 2012 R3 follows the same lifecycle dates as the initial release of Dynamics AX 2012
Definitions Show all What does Microsoft mean by major or minor product
A major product frequently ships as a top level aggregation of a bill of materials i
e
components and features that is released to customers
Major products generally receive a major version number and may be the parent of multiple minor products
Customers may obtain a major product through a variety of methods including retail purchase web download and or volume licensing
Typical examples of a Microsoft major product defined by the Microsoft Lifecycle Policy include
Microsoft Dynamics 365Microsoft Exchange ServerMicrosoft OfficeMicrosoft SQL ServerMicrosoft Windows Minor products are an aggregation of a bill of materials i
e
components and features that is based on the code of a major product
Minor products bear names that can be easily identified and associated with the related major product
Customers may obtain them through Software Assurance the Microsoft Business Solutions Dynamics Enhancement maintenance program or through another promotional plan
An example of this would be Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2
The major product is Windows Server 2012 which has its own lifecycle as a business and developer product
Windows Server 2012 R2 is a minor product based on the Windows Server 2012 code base and takes on the lifecycle of the major release
This means that the minor product may receive a lifecycle that is shorter than 10 years
In addition both the major and minor releases will end support on the same day
What is a component of a Microsoft product
A component is defined as a set of files or features that is included with a Microsoft major product
Components may be shipped with the product included in a product service pack or update or released at a later date as a web download
How do I know which product or platform a component is associated with
This information is generally specified in the component s End User License Agreement EULA What is a program add on
A program add on is a utility or feature that aids in accomplishing a task or set of tasks
What is a tool
A tool is a utility or feature that aids in accomplishing a task or set of tasks

Service Packs and Updates Show all How long do you provide security updates for your products
For business developer and desktop operating system software security updates will be available for supported service packs for the duration of the product s lifecycle through the end of the Extended Support Customers do not need to sign up for Extended Hotfix Support to receive security updates during the Extended Support phase
For consumer and multimedia software security updates will be available for supported service packs for the duration of the product s lifecycle through the end of Mainstream Support For more information about the support timeline for a specific product search the Lifecycle Product Database
What is the policy for service packs
The Microsoft Lifecycle Policy requires that the product s supported service pack be installed to receive technical support and security updates
Service Pack PolicyWhen a new service pack is released Microsoft will provide either 12 or 24 months of support for the previous service packSupport for previous service packs is either 12 or 24 months and varies by product family for example Windows Office servers or developer tools Support timelines for service packs will remain consistent within the product familyMicrosoft will publish specific support timelines for a previous service pack when the new service pack is releasedWhen support for a service pack ends Microsoft will no longer provide security updates non security updates or other updates for that service pack
When support for a product ends support of that product s service packs will also end
The product s support lifecycle supersedes the Service Pack Policy
Customers are highly encouraged to stay on a supported service pack to ensure they are on the latest and most secure version of their product
For customers on unsupported service pack versions Microsoft offers commercially reasonable support as follows
Commercially reasonable support incidents will be provided through Microsoft Customer Service and Support as well as through managed support offerings from Microsoft such as Premier Support There will be no option to engage Microsoft product development resources and technical workarounds may be limited or not possible
If the support incident requires escalation to development for further guidance requires a non security update or requires a security update customers will be asked to upgrade to a supported service pack
A matrix of the Microsoft product families and the duration of service pack support for each product family is as follows
Product FamilyDuration of service pack support Windows Client and Servers 24 Months Dynamics 24 Months Office 12 Months Servers 12 Months Developer Tools 12 Months Consumer Software Multimedia and Games 12 MonthsFor information about support for a product or for a service pack search the Lifecycle Product Database
Must I have the latest service pack installed to apply a security related update or an update that is not security related
An update should only be installed on the service pack for which it was designed
Microsoft creates security updates for supported service packs whenever commercially reasonable and are available to all customers
You can request an update that is not security related for service packs that are supported per the Service Pack Policy
Is the Extended Hotfix Support program required for customers to receive security updates
No
If a security update is created it will be made available to all customers through the standard security release process
The monthly security release occurs on the second Tuesday of the month
Would Microsoft ever release non security updates during Extended Support without Extended Hotfix Support
Yes
Microsoft Lifecycle Policy permits the creation and broad distribution of certain non security updates during the Extended Support phase
For example it may be necessary to provide a non security update that enables continued connectivity and servicing through the Automatic Update or Windows Server Update Service
What happens if Microsoft releases a security update the same day a product reaches the end of support
In the event Microsoft releases a security update on the same day that a product is scheduled to end its support lifecycle support of the security update will continue for a minimum of 30 days

If I am running a Microsoft product that is currently supported under the Lifecycle Policy but my operating system is no longer supported can I still receive support
If the problem is specific to the Microsoft product and it is within the Lifecycle Policy Microsoft will provide support
If the problem is a result of the combination of the operating system and the Microsoft product the problem will not be supported
After the Microsoft assisted and paid support offerings have ended what are my options if I want to continue to receive support
Microsoft encourages all customers to remain current to ensure that they stay supported and can take advantage of innovations found in the latest products
Staying current also minimizes security risks compliance risks and frequently lowers the total cost of ownership
Once a product transitions out of support no further support will be provided for the product
This means that customers will NOT have access to
Security updates or non security hotfixesFree or paid assisted support optionsMicrosoft product development resourcesUpdates to online content Knowledge Base articles etc
Online content may be available if the product is still within the Self Help Support phase
I do not need non security updates I only need phone support during the Extended Support phase
Must I have an Extended Hotfix Support contract
No

How will the Lifecycle Policy affect telephone and web support options that are customized to meet the requirements of home users and home office customers
Business home and home office users can access telephone or web support throughout Mainstream and Extended Support published dates for that product
How is a component supported under Microsoft s Lifecycle Policy
A component receives the same support as its parent product or platform
When a parent product or platform is in Mainstream or Extended Support so is the component
When a parent product or platform reaches end of support so does the component
For example
If a component is licensed for Microsoft Windows support ends for the component on the same date that support ends for Windows
Note
Sometimes a component will receive security updates or feature enhancements that are independent of its parent product
We encourage customers to install component updates as they become available
