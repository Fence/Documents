What is NET Core
NET Core is a set of runtime library and compiler components which can be used in various configurations for device and cloud workloads
Cross platform and open source NET Core provides a light weight development model and the flexibility to work a variety of development tools OS platforms
NET Core is available on GitHub under the MIT license
NET Core refers to several technologies including NET Core ASP
NET Core and Entity Framework Core
2
How does NET Core ship
NET Core will have major and minor releases which represent related but separate release streams
Major releases will be highly stable low change releases
A major release will be supported for 3 years after it ships or 12 months after the next major release ships whichever is shorter
For example NET Core 1
0 will be a major release and supported for 12 months after the release of NET Core 2
0
A major release may have multiple minor releases
For example NET Core 1
0 may be updated with NET Core 1
1 1
2 etc
Minor releases represent a faster rate of change and innovation and will be supported within the same 3 year window as the parent major release
Customers need to be at the latest minor release level within 3 months in order to continue to be supported
For example once NET Core 1
2 is released customers will need to update from NET Core 1
1 to NET Core 1

How will the support lifecycle for NET Core work
Microsoft will support both the stable major and more frequent minor trains
A customer can choose which train they are on and receive updates for their train
For example a customer may choose the stable NET 1
0 release train and as long as they stay on this train they will be supported for 3 years or 12 months after the release of the next stable release e

2
0 A customer may also choose to be on the faster release cadence and install NET Core 1
1 when it is available
Support will be available as long as the customer stays on the latest minor update level
For e
g
once NET Core 1
2 ships the customer on the faster release train will need to update to NET Core 1
2 within 3 months in order to receive support

Where can I find the end date for specific releases of NET Core
You can find the end date for all NET Core releases here 5
How does the support lifecycle for ASP
NET Core and Entity Framework Core work
ASP
NET Core and Entity Framework Core ship as part of NET Core releases and will follow the lifecycle of the parent release
6
What about third party components
In some cases installing a third party component or library via NuGet may be a pre requisite for using NET Core
Support for these components will come from the vendor that ships those components or libraries
NET Core releases for certain platforms such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux will be published by Red Hat rather than Microsoft
For these platforms updates for NET Core will be made available to the vendor for deployment through their systems
7
What if I take NET Core sources from GitHub
Customers who obtain NET Core source code from GitHub and build it themselves can get fixes and updates in source form from GitHub and incorporate these into their application
8
What is the relationship between NET Core and NET Framework
NET Core and the NET Framework for the most part have a subset superset relationship
NET Core is named as Core since it contains the core features from the NET Framework for both the runtime and framework libraries
For example NET Core and the NET Framework share the GC the JIT and types such as String and List T NET Core was created so that NET could be open source cross platform and be used in more resource constrained environments
9
Why do NET Core releases not follow the same support lifecycle as the NET Framework
NET Core is a new development platform and releases for NET Core will follow an agile and faster release cadence
Applications based on the NET Framework are widely deployed across hundreds of millions of computers and therefore there is a high bar for compatibility and stability
This results in releases for the NET Framework being less frequent and more scoped in the nature and number of changes
Due to these differences NET Core releases will follow their own support lifecycle

I am using NET Framework 4
5
x or 4
6
x
Does this mean I need to update my application to work with NET Core
No
NET Core releases are a new development platform
If you are using the NET Framework 4
5
x or NET 4
6
x you do not need to update your application to work with NET Core
That said the NET Core development platform offers several advantages over the Microsoft NET Framework you can find more information here
