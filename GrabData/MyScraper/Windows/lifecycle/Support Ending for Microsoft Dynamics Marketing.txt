In line with our support policy existing customers with an Enterprise Agreement and those who have purchased licenses directly through MOSP web direct will have the option to request renewal of their existing subscription agreements according to the customer renewal date but only until October 31st 2017
For example if a customer s Enterprise Agreement 3 years subscription terms can be renewed in October 2017 the Dynamics Marketing product will be available and supported until October 2020
If a customer s MOSP agreement 1 year subscription terms can be renewed in July 2017 the Dynamics Marketing product will be available and supported until July 2018
