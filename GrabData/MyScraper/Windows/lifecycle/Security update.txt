Back to Microsoft Lifecycle home page Microsoft is committed to providing products with improved security
Our long term goal is to remove security vulnerabilities from all our products before they are released
To realize the dream of Trustworthy Computing is a key element of our vision
Although we strive to remove vulnerabilities during development software vulnerabilities remain a fact today and we must be prepared to respond when they are discovered
Microsoft advises customers to install the latest product releases security updates and service packs to remain as secure as possible
