I don t really like green soups
Split pea cream of broccoli eek
I will RUN for the hills
Dinner parties can get awkward when I suddenly disappear when green soup is served
I know it s a strange statement to make is it the color green or is it the specific vegetables used
It may be my aversion to all things related to mucous yes I m in medical school and I totally queeze at the site of mucous if you see me please cough the other way So I guess I m going to go with a thick soup consistency with a green color
Since I don t like green soups that knocks out a number of popular soups to make in my kitchen
Orange soups that s where the money is
Give me an orange soup and I ll devour it in seconds
I ve previously made a Carrot ginger soup that was great and now I ve made an identical looking but completely different tasting curried butternut squash and sweet potato soup
