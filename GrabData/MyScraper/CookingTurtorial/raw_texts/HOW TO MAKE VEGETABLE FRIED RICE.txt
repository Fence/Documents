4 cups rice cooked the day before
1 to 2 eggs optional for vegans 1 to 2 cups minced vegetables recommended ones are shiitake mushrooms peas chives bell pepper cabbage lettuce carrots broccoli corn kernels and cauliflower 3 Tbsp
peanut oil or corn oil

garlic crushed and finely minced
2 Tbsp
soy sauce
Salt and black pepper to taste
1 tsp
sesame oil Spatula
Large wok or deep skillet 1
Before cooking moisten the day-old rice with a little water
Cooked rice tends to stick together in big chunks so you need to crumble the chunks to get the rice ready before using it in this recipe
It will be easier to crumble rice with your hands just make sure your hands are very well soaped and rinsed
Do not wipe them dry
The water on your hands will keep the rice from sticking to them
Set the rice aside
2
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil on medium-high heat
Beat eggs and pour into the skillet cooking them scrambled-egg style
3
Transfer eggs onto a separate plate and cut into thin strips
Set aside
4
Pour the remaining oil into the skillet and heat it
Add the minced garlic and stir-fry until it is golden brown and fragrant
Be careful not to overcook or it will turn bitter
5
Quickly add the vegetables one at a time starting from the one that takes longest to cook
A good rule of thumb is to go from the hardest vegetables to the softest
Fry until the vegetables are cooked through and shiny
6
Add rice
Mix well with the vegetable and season with soy sauce salt and pepper
Cook on high heat while mixing the ingredients
7
Add in the scrambled egg strips to the mixture
And you re done
Now transfer your fried rice to a serving plate and serve immediately
