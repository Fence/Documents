When cooking fried chicken flavor is important that s true
But a flavorful fried chicken is a mere shadow of its full potential if it lacks a crackling kick
It s an unwritten rule
fried chicken needs to have a crispy crust always
So are you up to the challenge of making tasty crispy fried chicken
Let us help you out with this guide
2 1 2 lb
cut-up chicken parts if these came from the freezer make sure they re completely thawed
2 cups flour
1 tablespoon salt
1 1 2 teaspoon pepper
1 egg
3 4 cup water
Oil Bowls for the seasoned flour and batter
Cast iron skillet or pot
Tongs
Cooling rack 1
Make the batter
In a bowl mix flour salt and pepper
Then beat the egg yolk and add water
Gradually pour the egg mixture onto the dry ingredients
Mix the ingredients well until you have a thick and smooth batter
2
Prepare the seasoned flour
Simply mix flour salt and pepper together in another bowl
3
Heat the oil
Remember that you can either pan-fry or deep-fry the chicken
If you choose to pan-fry make sure the oil is one inch deep
Heat it to 350 F 175 C If you want deep-fried chicken pour as much oil as is needed to completely cover the chicken parts
Make sure the oil reaches 325 F 185 C before putting the chicken in the pot
4
One by one roll the chicken pieces in seasoned flour
Then dip them into the batter then in the seasoned flour again for one last time
Make sure all their parts are covered
5
Let the chicken rest for a while to allow the coating to stick to the skin
6
After a while drop the chicken pieces into the skillet or pot using tongs
Do this very carefully as you don t want the hot oil to splash on you
Make sure not to overcrowd the skillet or pan since overcrowding decreases the temperature and causes greasy fried chicken
To avoid overcrowding fry the chicken pieces in batches
7
Take the chicken pieces out from the skillet or pot when they turn golden brown
Place them in a cooling rack and allow them to drain
8
Fry the remaining pieces the same way
Add more clean oil if needed
Now take a bite and test the crunch and try not to finish them up before everyone else gets to the table
