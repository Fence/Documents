The rich creamy taste of cheese combines with the sweet crunchy goodness of graham crackers in this classic New York style recipe
Now while purists may prefer their cheesecakes as plain as this do feel free to experiment with different types of toppings if you like
1 cup Philadelphia cream cheese softened
15 pieces Graham crackers crushed Tip
Put the crackers in a plastic bag and close the bag before you begin crushing the crackers for less mess
2 Tbsp
butter melted
4 eggs
1 cup sour cream
1 Tbsp
vanilla extract
1 1 2 cups white sugar
1 4 cup all-purpose flour
3 4 cup milk 2 mixing bowls
1 springform pan If you don t have one I strongly recommend you get one because fragile cakes such as cheesecakes are very difficult to remove from the pan if you re using a regular pan
If you want to risk it you can use an eight-inch greased cake pan lined with parchment paper but it s not going to be easy to take the cake out
Remember
you ve been warned
Spatula or wooden spoon for mixing Now this cheesecake is delectable as it is but if you like you can also top it with fresh fruits or glazed fruits such as strawberries cherries blueberries peach apple or a combination of any of these
Be sure to place the fruit glazing once the cheesecake cools just before you put the cheesecake in the refrigerator
Or drizzle your cake with chocolate syrup or caramel just before serving
Or sprinkle it with crushed cinnamon or cocoa powder
The options are endless when you re talking about such a versatile dessert as cheesecake
