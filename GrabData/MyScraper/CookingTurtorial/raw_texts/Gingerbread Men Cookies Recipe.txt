For me the Yuletide holidays are simply incomplete without a plate of gingerbread men cookies on the table
They part of tradition and their presence brings back memories of childhood
If you want to make your own gingerbread men just follow these instructions
These cookies are so easy to make you can even let children help you
3 cups all-purpose flour
3 4 tsp
baking soda
1 2 tsp
salt
1 cup unsalted butter
1 2 cup white sugar
2 3 cup unsulfured molasses spray the cup with non-stick vegetable spray to prevent the molasses from sticking to the cup 1 large egg
2 tsp
ground ginger
1 tsp
ground cinnamon
1 4 tsp
ground cloves
1 4 tsp
ground nutmeg
1 1 2 Tbsp
milk or light cream
1 tsp
pure vanilla extract
1 2 cup unsalted butter
2 cups sifted confectioners sugar Measuring cup
Large bowl
Electric mixer with paddle
Gingerbread cutter
Spatula
Parchment paper
Roller
Wire rack 1
First make the confectioners frosting
Beat 1 2 cup butter until it becomes smooth
Add the vanilla extract
2
Put the mixer on low speed
Add the powdered sugar little by little
3
Add the milk
Switch to high speed
Beat the mixture until your frosting become fluffy and light
If you want colored frosting you can add food coloring drop by drop at this point while you continue blending
4
Set your frosting aside
5
Now sift together the flour baking soda salt ginger cloves nutmeg and cinnamon in a large bowl
6
Using the electric mixer beat together the sugar and 1 2 cup butter until the mixture becomes light and fluffy
Add the molasses and egg and beat the mixture again until everything is well combined
7
Add the flour mixture into the liquid mixture then beat again until everything is thoroughly mixed
8
Divide the dough into two equal parts
Wrap each separately in plastic
Refrigerate the dough for two hours or even overnight until it becomes firm
9
Preheat the oven to 177 C 350 F Place rack at the center of the oven
10
Roll out the dough to about inch thickness on a lightly floured surface
Then cut out the cookies using a gingerbread cutter
11
Line two baking sheets with parchment paper
Put your cookies onto the backing sheet atop the parchment paper
Make sure you leave at least 1 cm space per cookie
12
Bake the cookies until they are firm and the edges begin turning brown
This normally takes about 8-12 minutes
13
Take the cookies out of the oven and leave them on the baking sheets for about a minute to let them cool
Then you can transfer them to the wire rack to let them cool completely
14
Place the frosting in a pastry bag fitted with a decorative tip
Decorate the gingerbread man as desired
This mixture makes about three dozen cookies depending on how big your cookie cutter is
Reply I LOVE Gingerbread men they re the best thing about Christmas
I tend to make them a little ticker than you have indicated in this recipe
But I like to keep the middle parts slightly doughy
Ummmm I think I am getting a craving to make some right now
