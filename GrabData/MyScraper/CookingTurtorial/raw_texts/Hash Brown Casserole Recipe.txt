Sometimes it can be a huge pain to make breakfast in the morning especially when it comes to large families
If you want to save some time and try out a new recipe a hash brown casserole might be just what you need
You can put this together the night before so when you wake up there is a delicious breakfast waiting
If you have a self-timed slow cooker this will be even easier to make
32 ounces frozen hash brown potatoes thawed out 1 4 teaspoon salt
1 4 teaspoon pepper
1 2 cup chopped onion
2 cups shredded cheese your choice what kind 10
75 ounce can of cream of mushroom soup don t dilute it 2 cups sour cream Step 1
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently
Step 2
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter
This will prevent sticking so you don t have a huge mess to clean up
Step 3
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1
5 hours
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2
5 hours longer
Step 4
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer
It s best when served with scrambled eggs
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables
It s generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them
This will ensure they don t turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it s put in
If you add in raw meat it likely won t fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use
