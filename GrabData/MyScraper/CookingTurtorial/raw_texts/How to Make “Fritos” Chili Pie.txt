Fritos Chili Pie is always a favorite of children and for those adults who are still kids at heart
The recipe is very simple to make too so it can be a quick meal on movie night or on any night when you just don t have time to prepare a meal requiring more prep time
1 bag of regular size Fritos
1 can of your favorite chili
1 8-16 oz block of medium cheddar cheese
1 small onion diced optional sliced jalapeno optional to spice it up for the adults In regular soup bowls fill about one-half to three-quarters of each bowl with Fritos
Grate the cheddar cheese and dice the small onion and put to the side
Heat the chili in a pot
Pour one or two ladle fulls of chili over the Fritos in each bowl
Immediately add a small handful of cheese on top while the chili is good and piping hot so the cheese starts to melt
Stir just before eating
Add optional ingredients last
Originally Frito pies were a southern invention and they were made by opening a small bag of Fritos and putting the chili and cheese directly into the bag
Be sure to buy the original brand Fritos because other brands tend to get too soggy
Also be sure to buy regular size Fritos because the larger dipping Fritos stay too hard
If you want a crunchier Frito pie let the chili cool down just a little so it doesn t steam up the Fritos
You can also keep mixing in fresh Fritos as you eat the Frito pie
To make it fancy you can add other types of cheeses but the traditional cheddar is always a crowd pleaser
Sometimes it is just better to stick with the original
The best Frito pie is made from left-over home-made chili of course
