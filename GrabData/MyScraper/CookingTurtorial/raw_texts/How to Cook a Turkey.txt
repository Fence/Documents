Turkey Fresh or Frozen
Stuffing optional Salt Pepper
Melted Butter or Oil Baking Dish
Meat Thermometer Step 1
Step 1
If you are using a frozen turkey allow it to thaw in its original plastic wrapper in the fridge
Allow for five hours per pound 500g to ensure you ve thoroughly cooked your turkey
A quicker method to thaw the turkey is to cover the turkey with cold water ideally in the sink
Every 30 minutes you will need to change the water with fresh cold water
Allow one hour per pound
Step 2
Prepare the turkey by removing giblets and neck
Rinse and wipe the cavity sprinkle with salt and pepper or stuff lightly
If you decide to stuff the turkey make sure you fasten the skin over the cavity with skewers
Step 3
Preheat oven to 325 F 160 C Step 4
Place turkey breast side up in roasting pan and brush with melted butter or oil
Tent loosely with foil
Step 5
Roast for about 20 minutes per pound or until juices run clear when turkey is pierced and when thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 180 F 82 C for a stuffed turkey or 170 F 77 C for an unstuffed turkey
Remove tent for last hour of roasting
Step 6
When the turkey is finished transfer the bird to a warm platter
Tent with foil and let stand for 20 to 30 minutes
The idea behind tenting is to let the jouices redistribute from the interior where the heat has driven them to the exterior
In theory this makes for juicier meat all around and reduces the amount of juice lost when the meat is carved or cut
Step 7
Carve eat and enjoy
