SOME NOTES ON THE INGREDIENTS
The golden syrup used in authentic flapjack is not like the popular brands that people are used to like Karo corn syrup
Traditional golden syrup has a distinct taste and smell that commercial ones don t characterize
Nevertheless it can be substituted with whatever syrup that s available
Honey can also be used in place of golden syrup
Soft butter is best when left at room temperature for at least 4 8 hours
Bakers usually take it out of the chiller and have it stand overnight
Different kinds of nuts can be used like hazelnut and walnuts
Make sure they re fresh and uncooked because old nuts can make your cake taste like wood
Another variation of this recipe would use eggs to hold the cake together
It s not necessary and it only adds calories
The oats can be quickly cooked on a pan with no oil over low heat to make it crunchy and bring out the toasty aroma
This scrumptious pastry can be served with tea or coffee
Make two batches in one go by easily doubling what s asked in the recipe
Keep half of them in a zip lock bag or a sealed container and it can last for 5 days or longer when they re frozen
While the other half is for the hungry baker
