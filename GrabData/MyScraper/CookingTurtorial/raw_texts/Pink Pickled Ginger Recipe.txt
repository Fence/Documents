Pink Pickled Ginger
Not Just for Sushi Peter Piper picked a peck of pink pickled ginger and thought that it was really zesty good
This Japanese side dish called gari in Japanese is usually served with sushi
The bland fishy taste matches well with the sweet and sour ginger as it cleanses the palate and enhances appetite
It is easy to prepare and it can last for days when stored in a cool place
INGREDIENTS
1 kg young ginger
1 2 cup sea salt
3 cups rice vinegar
1 cup sugar Step 1
Wash the ginger well scrubbing the thin light brown skin off with water
You may also use salt to scrub off the skin
Step 2
Dilute the salt in a bowl of water
Soak the ginger in the bowl of saltwater for one to two hours
Drain your ginger and let them dry or wipe with paper towels
Slice the ginger thinly with a sharp knife or a mandolin for consistent thickness
Step 3
Prepare a sterilized jar that you will use as your preservation vessel
It must be completely dry and devoid of any object that may cause odor-causing bacteria
Place the sliced ginger in the jar carefully stacking them one by one so that the space is maximized
Step 4
In a pot boil your 3 cups of sugar mixed with 1 cup sugar
Upon boiling pour the hot mixture into the ginger-filled jar
Place on the lid and wait for it to cool before placing it in the refrigerator
