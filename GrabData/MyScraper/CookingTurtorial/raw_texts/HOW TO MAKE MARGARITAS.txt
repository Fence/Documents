It s a fun vacation in a glass
So who could blame you if you would like to enjoy it at home as well as at a bar
This recipe is good for two servings
To make more than two servings simply multiply the recipe
2 oz tequila
1 oz lime juice
1 oz orange liqueur or triple sec
lime wedges
salt optional preferably kosher salt which has a purer taste because it has no iodine crushed ice optional cocktail glass
cocktail shaker or covered pitcher
cocktail strainer Of course you can always raise the amount of the tequila for more buzz the amount of lime juice for more zing or the amount of triple sec or liqueur for more sweetness
True margarita does not need sugar but if you want your margarita sweet feel free to add sugar as is often done anyway
The quality of a margarita mix is determined by the quality of the tequila and triple sec used to make the drink
If you want premium margarita spend on the best bottles of tequila and triple sec
For a slushy version of margarita crush some ice cubes in an ice crusher and mix that with the drinks
You can also skip the cocktail shaker or covered pitcher and just mix the liquid ingredients and ice in a blender to get a shake-like consistency
Indulge
