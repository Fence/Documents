The sangria is a favorite summer cocktail from sunny Spain
With this delicious drink s unique blend of fruit juices and liquor how can anyone not love it
It goes excellently well with both outdoor barbeques and traditional Spanish tapas
There are actually many different recipes for sangria but this one is a Spanish classic
4-6 oranges for making orange juice
1 whole orange
1 whole lemon
1 whole lime
1 2 cup white sugar
1 bottle 750 ml dry red wine
1 1 2 cups rum or spice rum or Burgundy wine Juicer optional Strainer
Knife
Glass pitcher
Wooden spoon or spatula
Large goblets or tall drinking glasses to serve the sangria 1
Take 4 to 6 oranges slice each in half and squeeze them to make fresh orange juice
You can use your juicer for this
Strain the mixture to remove the pulp and seeds
If you are using orange juice from a bottle you can skip this part but I would recommend fresh orange juice if you want the best taste for your drink
2
Chill all your fruits rum wine and orange juice for a few hours
3
Take your whole orange lime and lemon out of the refrigerator and slice them thinly into rounds
Place the slices in a pitcher
4
Pour in the chilled rum and sugar into the pitcher
Keep the mixture in the refrigerator for at least two hours until you are just about ready to serve it
5
Before you serve the sangria crush the fruits in the pitcher lightly with a wooden spoon then stir in the chilled orange juice and wine
Adjust the sweetness of the mixture by adding more sugar if necessary
And that s that
Pour the sangria into individual glasses
If you wish you could garnish the goblets with slices of fruit or sprigs of mint leaves
Serve the drinks quickly while they re very cold
