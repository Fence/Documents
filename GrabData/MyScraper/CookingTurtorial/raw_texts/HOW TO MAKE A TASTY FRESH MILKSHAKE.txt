Commercial milkshakes are more often than not artificially flavored too sugary and with not enough of the authentic fresh taste our tastebuds are hankering after
If you re looking for really good milkshake one that s tasty fresh and healthy then it s about time you learn how to make your own
3 cups of a fruit of your choice berries work exceptionally well 1 cups of vanilla ice cream
2 cups of milk
cup of crushed ice
Sugar optional Blender
Knife
Chopping board 1
Choose fresh fruits for your milkshake
Make sure the fruit has no wrinkled or bruised parts
The fruit should be firm have a bright color and smell sweet
Traditionally people use only one fruit for their milkshake but if you re feeling bold and adventurous you could try using a combination of fruits
Limit yourself to a maximum of three fruits though
2
Cut the fruits in small chunks
The smaller the chunks the easier it will be to puree them
3
Put the fruit chunks in the blender
Blend them until you have a chunk-free puree
4
Add the vanilla ice cream milk and crushed ice
Start the blender again
It will not take more than two minutes for the ingredients to mix up well
5
Put in some sugar if you want sugar in your shake
But taste the shake first
The fact is since fresh fruits are already sweet sugar is often unnecessary
But if you have a sweet tooth you may want a bit more sweetness so add sugar according to your preference
Then turn the blender on for a few more seconds to mix the sugar thoroughly in
6
Pour the milkshake into a chilled glass
Add some fruit garnishing
Now enjoy your tasty healthy fresh milkshake
Slurp it away
