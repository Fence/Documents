I have one week left to go in my Internal Medicine rotation
When medical students hit that final week they disappear from the world as we know it
They put on big sweatshirts comfortable pants attempt to study but mostly panic
Ahhhhhhhhhh
I have to know what again
Oh just about everything I ever learned about medicine
You ve caught me
I m in exam mode There is such a thing a flip is switched and suddenly all you eat are stale bagels you stop going to the gym and you never wear your contact lenses but you DO shower purely because it s a nice study break So after a few days of feeling like I m a walking marshmallow with a brain full of mush what does the heart do again
I decided to head into my kitchen and use my stove not just the toaster to make sweet and sour eggplant
