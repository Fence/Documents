Due to a delightful clerical error a scheduled babysitter when we forgot Alex would be home from work I got to have a weekday lunch with my husband on President s Day
In a restaurant
With linens on the table and no sippy cups in a two-table radius
Oh and maybe something petite bubbly and pink in a glass
I admit nothing
But man sometimes I think everyone should have kids just so they can get 80 times the joy out of excursions that would have been ordinary in another era
I am joking of course
You should have kids because you detest sleeping past 6 a
m
Whoops there I go again
It must be the pink bubbly
