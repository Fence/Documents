When it comes to making toasted almond truffles then the process is relatively simple and anybody should be able to make some truffles that are delicious
What follows are the easy steps that should be taken and the ingredients that you require to make this wonderful little treat
To make 24 servings you will need
half a cup of evaporated milk a quarter of a cup of sugar two cups of milk chocolate chips one teaspoon of almond extract or a teaspoon of vanilla extract and one cup of toasted and finely sliced almonds
Instructions
1
To begin with you need to put both the sugar and the evaporated milk into a saucepan and bring it to the boil slowly over a medium to low heat and always stir it in order to prevent the ingredients from sticking to the pan and burning
When it comes to the boil you should continue to stir it for three minutes as you keep the heat going before moving to the next stage
2
After the three minutes are past you then need to take the mixture off the heat and add the chocolate chips and keep stirring so the mixture becomes nice and smooth
At this point you will then need to add in the extract that you plan on using and stir again so everything is very well mixed
3
The final step is to put the mixture into the refrigerator for 90 minutes to two hours and then shape it into balls that are approximately one inch in diameter before rolling them in the nuts to ensure they are very well covered
The truffles should then be placed back into the refrigerator until you are ready to serve them to ensure they keep their consistency as room temperature for a prolonged period of time will not be good for them
That is basically how you make toasted almond truffles and you can see that there is nothing difficult about it
The recipe will take you just over two hours in total including refrigeration time so plan ahead and give your guests a fantastic little treat
