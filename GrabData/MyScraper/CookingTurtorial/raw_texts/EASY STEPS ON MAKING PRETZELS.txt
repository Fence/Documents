INGREDIENTS For the dough 4 cups of flour about half a kilo 4 tablespoon of brown sugar
2 tablespoon of salt sea salt is better 1 tablespoon of yeast dissolved in a cup of lukewarm water For the pretzel coating 1 tablespoon of baking soda dissolved in a cup of boiling temperature water
1 egg beaten
1 teaspoon water added to the beaten egg Optional seasoning like vegetable oil sesame seeds etc
PROCEDURES
1
In a big bowl mix the salt brown sugar and yeast with a cup of lukewarm water
Whip the mixture while gradually adding the flour until the dough is smooth and free from bumps
If you think the dough is a little too sticky add more flour
Tip
It is better to let the dough sit overnight inside a plastic container placed in the fridge
Doing so would make the bread a more fluffier and softer
The dough will rise overnight so you better use a large container
2
Cut the dough into 4 to 12 pieces depending on the size you intend for the dough
Roll each piece to make a rope
Just make sure that the strips are very thin
If possible make its diameter less than a standard pencil
Bigger pretzels can be made from ropes with thickness of about that of a cigar s
3
Shape the dough rope into an upside down U
Get the ends together and twist them leaving a circle at the two tails

Bring the tails on the circle
Flatten the ends using your fingers and blend them in the dough
When you are satisfied with the shape of your pretzel you can now place the dough on top of a greased cookie sheet

Allow the pretzels to rise for about thirty minutes

Brush the pretzels with a mixture of water and baking soda
