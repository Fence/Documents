Scrambled eggs are a paradox to many
they look and sound so simple to cook and yet in actuality very few can make really good fluffy delectable scrambled eggs
Well here s a foolproof recipe to make the perfect scrambled eggs for yourself and your family
Have a beautiful morning
6 eggs large
1 4 cup low fat milk Avoid whole milk because its taste tends to dominate the eggs
Skim milk may be used but it will produce a slightly runnier consistency
Don t use half-and-half or any kind of cream
3 dashes of salt
Oil or butter for frying Mixing bowl
Wire whisk
Frying pan preferably non-stick
Spatula
Serving platter 1
Crack the eggs and place contents in the mixing bowl
Add milk and salt
Whisk the egg mixture for two minutes using an upward tilted circular direction to add fluffiness to the mixture
Keep doing this until the mixture becomes frothy and even colored
Alternatively you could place the egg mixture in a blender and mix for about 25 seconds
2
Heat your frying pan over medium heat
If you are using butter allow the butter to melt in the pan but avoid burning it by lifting the pan off the heat as soon as the butter starts to bubble
You could also add some oil to the butter as pure butter tends to burn more easily
Lower your heat
3
Add the egg mixture
Don t stir immediately but just allow the egg mixture to settle slightly into pan
Tilt the skillet in a circular direction to distribute the runny parts evenly
Make sure eggs don t start to brown
4
With a spatula break apart the large pieces as they form
5
Flip over the eggs and allow them to cook for about 15 to 25 seconds more
Lift the pan to avoid browning the eggs
Remember they must stay fluffy and yellow
As soon as no runny parts remain transfer your scrambled eggs to a serving platter
If desired you could sprinkle a little more salt and pepper before serving
For a Mexican touch serve eggs with salsa
