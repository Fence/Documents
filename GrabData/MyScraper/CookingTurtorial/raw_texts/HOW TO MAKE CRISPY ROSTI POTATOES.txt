HOW TO MAKE CRISPY ROSTI POTATOES This is a recipe that a lot of people seem to struggle with at first so be prepared to practice a bit by following the steps below
WHAT YOU WILL NEED
2 baking potatoes
3 green onions minced
1 garlic clove minced
Salt and pepper
Vegetable oil for shallow frying STEPS
1
In pot boil potatoes and let them cook for seven minutes
2
Drain potatoes and allow them to cool down
3
Peel and grate them into a bowl
With the grating it needs to be quite thick so avoid the finest part on the grater or you will start to cause yourself problems further on
4
Add in onions and garlic and season with salt and pepper according to your desired taste
Mix well
5
Use a chef s rings that are around four inches in size to make the shape and place four of them on a baking sheet and fill each one with the mixture that you have just prepared
Press this mixture down so it then forms a cake and then put them in your fridge to cool for around twenty minutes
6
Heat about 5mm of oil in a non stick fry pan and take the chef ring off the cake and add it to the hot oil
Each side should be cooked for between four and five minutes or until you see it going a nice golden brown color at which point it is time to turn it over to do the other side
7
Drain on paper towel
