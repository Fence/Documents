The name sounds like a very fancy read
difficult gourmet French dish but chicken cordon bleu is actually quite simple to make
Try it and see
Bon appetit
4 pieces boneless chicken breasts skinned and trimmed Tip
Opt for smaller breasts so that they are thinner and therefore get done more easily in the oven
Salt and pepper to taste
4-6 slices Swiss or Gruyere cheese
4 slices cooked ham
1 2 cup dry bread crumbs
Egg 2 small mixing bowls
Skillet
Spatula
Shallow baking dish
4 toothpicks
Non-stick cooking spray 1
Preheat your oven to 350 F
2
Pound your chicken breasts so that they are just 1 4 inch thick
3
Rub the chicken pieces with salt and pepper
4
Place one slice of cheese and one slice of ham on each chicken breast
5
Fold the breast over you can also roll it up if you like but I find folding much less complicated then use a toothpick to keep the chicken from unfolding or unrolling 6
Beat the egg dip the chicken into it then coat the chicken with bread crumbs
7
Coat your baking dish with some non-stick cooking spray then place the chicken in
8
Bake the chicken for about 35 to 40 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink
9
This is an optional step but highly recommended
Take the chicken out of the oven and top each with half a slice of cheese
Then put everything back into the oven and wait for the cheese to melt
Once your chicken cordon bleu is done take the chicken out of the oven cut each breast in half take out the toothpicks and serve immediately
This dish makes four servings and goes very well with a side dish of freshly cooked rice or hot buttered rolls
