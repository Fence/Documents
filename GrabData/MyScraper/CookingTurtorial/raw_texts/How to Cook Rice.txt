Cooking rice properly may seem like the most basic kitchen task yet somehow many people still seem to get it wrong
There are many different ways to cook rice properly and there are many different types of rice which all require different types of cooking
Investing in a rice cooker is a good idea too and it reduces cooking time and makes for an easy clean up
1 cup long grain white rice
1 cups water
Unsalted butter or olive oil optional Kosher salt optional Heavy based pot with tight fitting lid
Fine strainer Step 1

Rinsing rice helps get rid of any excess starch and impurities
Step 2
Place the rice in the pot along with the water and bring to a boil uncovered at medium heat
Step 3
When the rice is boiling turn the heat down to medium low
Place the lid on the pot however do not cover the top completely so that the steam has somewhere to escape
